					<p style="color: white;">Hey, Chukku. Happiest 1 month of knowing each other. I know it is super cheesy to do something like this. I know we haven't talked much and only met for like 5 mins. And the way we met was itself amazing. But I have learned one thing that love doesn't require anything but that click people talk about in books and movies. I'm glad to find someone as amazing as you and don't want to loose. You are that type of person a lifetime is spent with. We both are crazy and maybe that's why we are so great together, because your crazy matches mine. We have our problems and difficulties but you make it all worth it. You're a once in a lifetime person.</p>

I’d tell you how different I was before you and when you entered my life there was a before and after in me that everyone saw.

I’d tell you how floored I am by all you do, not just for me but for everyone.

 I want to take a moment to thank you for all you are and all you make me.

I’d tell you how truly happy you make me and every day I get to be a part of your life is the best day of my life.

I’d tell you how I look forward to going to sleep knowing your name will be the one I see when I open my eyes.

I’d tell you how I’ve screenshotted some of the things you’ve said because it still makes me smile.

I’d tell you how I save all our pictures and I haven’t deleted the first one we ever took and I look back it smiling.

And the time we spent together was truly the happiest part of my life. 

And every time we are about to part ways I miss you before we even say goodbye.

I’d tell you how much I miss you when we are apart. But it’s the good type of missing someone. Like I’m happy to have someone to miss.

I say I love you and hearing it back is a comfort because there were so many times in the past the air was filled with the silence of people who couldn’t reciprocate all I had to give.

					Gently, let us steep our love <br>
In the silence deep, as thus,<br>
Branches arching high above<br>
Twine their shadows over us.<br>

Let us blend our souls as one,<br>
Hearts’ and senses’ ecstasies,<br>
Evergreen, in unison<br>
With the pines’ vague lethargies.<br>

Dim your eyes and, heart at rest,<br>
Freed from all futile endeavor,<br>
Arms crossed on your slumbering breast,<br>
Banish vain desire forever.<br>


Let us yield then, you and I,<br>
To the waftings, calm and sweet,<br>
As their breeze-blown lullaby<br>
Sways the gold grass at your feet.<br>

And, when night begins to fall<br>
From the black oaks, darkening,<br>
In the nightingale’s soft call<br>
Our despair will, solemn, sing.<br>

					<p style="color: white;">You’ve been the example of what I deserve in a person. No one has ever treated me so well in my life. And maybe I say thank you too much but when you’ve given your best in the past and all people do is take what you have to offer and leave you’re left with an empty feeling.

I stand beside you and for the first time, I feel whole like everything that was ever missing before isn’t anymore.

There are times I look at you and I wonder how we got here. Of all the things I’ve done wrong in my life, you’re the one thing I’ve gotten right.

You seem to accept the past you weren’t a part of.

You take on my troubles and my problems like they are your own. And all I’ve ever known is taking care of myself and watching my own back. But with you, there’s a trust I’ve never known anyone.

You accept me in ways I’m still learning to accept myself. And through your love, you’ve taught me to love myself.

And you don’t need the explanations I want to give sometimes. This is why I am the way I am. This is why I act the way I do. You just take me for all I am and love me for it.

For every bad thing that’s happened to me and the things I didn’t deserve, you come in the form of everything I do deserve and everything I’ve only ever imagined.

You don’t judge me for my mistakes or me at my worst. You remind me of who I am at my best.

You’ve made me the best version of myself.

I truly believe you are the best person I’ve ever known.

And your looks are just the half of it. What makes you beautiful is who you are. It makes you the most attractive person I’ve ever known.

I look at you as everything I could want in a person. It’s a standard I couldn’t even come up with before you because you’ve exceeded everyone and everything I could have wanted.


I’d tell you, you’re the type of good that makes people better.

I’d tell you, you have the type of heart that has healed a broken one like mine.

I’d tell you, you’re the type of girl everyone should strive to be more like.

And I love you. I truly love you with everything I have in me.

I don’t know if it’s enough. And I don’t know where we go from here. But I find comfort in knowing someone like you exists in the world.</p>

					<p style="color: white;">So baby you say you want to love me? You say you want to go on this ride with me in your arms. But when I say there will be more ups and down than you can ever imagine, sometimes without any reason at all, will you still be able to love me? My mind is easily tricked by thoughts that consume me. I will ask you the same question nine times even if your answers are still the same, because none of it will feel quite right. I am a person damaged by the knots and ties of an overthinking mind. No action to me is simple. I cannot help falling into the pit of depression. My days are battles with my own mind which most of the times I keep losing against. I worry about panic attacks so much that I end up having one. Some days at 12pm in the afternoon, you can catch me sitting somewhere secluded, staring at nothing with tears rolling down my cheek and an unlit cigarette in my hand because of some distant or unusual thought you probably will not find any meaning behind. And some nights, I will get up from my sleep with my heart beating so fast that I can hear something trying to leap out but caged. I will not be able to move and maybe all of this because of some pimple in some weird place which I worry might be cancer or the fear of not having my parents anymore one day. My overthinking mind has trust issues beyond limits but at the same time is burdened by the fear of abandonment. In spite of my independent and strong front, I will be this over-protective and insecure person and some days even jealous. I will take out a hundred conclusions from a simple act of yours. Can you still promise to love me even when you hate me? I will always worry about me not being your home anymore. That all of a sudden you will not find me beautiful enough, funny enough, interesting enough. That one day you will not find me worthy of being yours enough. And these thoughts may consume me so much, that I will not be able to commit to you in the fear of breaking into millions before even joining into one. Days when I will not be pretty enough, screaming or silent, depressed or panicked, kohl smeared, lips bitten, hair all over my face, can you hold my little finger and be with me till the very end? Because I am tired of all these millions thoughts clouding my existence within myself every day. Every adventure turns into fear and every fear into a nightmare. We are not petty whiners, our problem is real. It is a frenzy to us, our brains programed to analyse and over analyse every detail. I may or may not be a damaged soul but there is this hollow pit inside me which eats me a little more every single day. So if one day I run for the hills, will you wait for me by that small bench at the park? Can you promise not to make me an insignificant blue dot in your starry universe? Because no matter what, I will always stay. </p>

					<p style="color: white;">Falling in love with you was not a choice. It just happened.

Too often people think we pick who we love and it goes from there. This is the furthest thing from the truth. Love chooses us. For me I just woke up one day and realized it was you. It had been you for a long time. I woke up and realized that if I could have you by my side everyday for the rest of time I’d be the luckiest person in the world.

Loving someone comes with the risk of knowing that they can completely destroy you, but you take the chance anyway. Feeling more hope than fear.

That’s what love really is, a hope and faith within someone other than yourself. Love is not understanding what you’re feeling because there isn’t a word in the English dictionary to describe what you feel. Love is reckless. Love is a hurricane. Love is also calm. Love is also peace. Love is also comfortable. Love is being able to put their happiness before yours. Love is being able to accept their flaws. Love is confusing. Love is difficult. Love is risky. But love above anything else has got to be the most wonderful, extraordinary and beautiful thing about this life.

I am in love with you.

I did not choose to fall in love with you. It simply happened. </p>

You have everything about the girl I used to dream about, and more.  And I would spend the rest of my life in making your life a fairy tale and give you what you deserve. To love you more than every difficult day ahead. To stand by you in the strongest storm. To make you smile in the saddest of days. To take care of you in your worst. And to be together till the end of time.</p>
